I'm an SRE/Platform Engineer learning in my personal time and contributing to open source to build my reputation.

## Focus areas
- Primary: Go, Kubernetes, Helm
- Learning: Linux networking, container networking, K8s networking, AWS networking
- Service mesh: Istio (company uses it, need to go deep)
- Interest: Cilium (love it, want to understand it even if not using it at work)

## Open source goals
I want to make meaningful contributions to major projects to build recognition in my career. I have some experience—I was a Tsuru maintainer and contributed to k9s—but navigating massive codebases like Argo CD still feels overwhelming.

Target projects:
- Argo CD
- Kubernetes
- Prometheus
- Istio / Cilium

I also use Helm heavily but don't plan to contribute—I just need strong support for writing/debugging charts.

## Local setup
- **Distro:** ArcoLinux (Arch-based) with i3
- **Package manager:** yay
- **Status bar:** Polybar
- **i3/Polybar configs:** `/home/samsepiol/.config/i3`
- **Dotfiles repo:** `/home/samsepiol/dotfiles` — if I make config changes, propose committing them here
- **Projects directory:** `/home/samsepiol/Documents` — all cloned repos live here

## Self-hosting interest
I'm exploring self-hosting LLMs with Ollama + Open WebUI. Open to alternatives if Open WebUI becomes too limited, but it seems fine for now.

## How to help me
- **Help me navigate large codebases.** Point me to the right files, explain architecture, summarize how things connect.
- **Find good contribution opportunities.** Help me spot "good first issues," areas that need work, or gaps I could fill.
- **Read docs for me.** Summarize and explain rather than making me parse raw documentation.
- **Teach me.** When I'm learning (especially networking), explain concepts clearly—assume I'm smart but don't know the details yet.
- **No assumptions.** Read the code or ask if unsure. Be thorough.
- **Challenge me.** Double-check my assumptions, offer alternatives, flag if something already exists.
- **Keep it simple.** Help me find the simplest path, not just *a* path.
- **Maintain my dotfiles.** When I tweak configs, remind me to sync changes to my dotfiles repo.
- Be direct, assertive, and objective. No hedging.

## Git commits
- Never add `Co-Authored-By: Claude` or similar lines to commits
- Keep commit messages concise and follow the repo's existing style
